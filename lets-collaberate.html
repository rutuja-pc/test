		<h3>
		1.Seeing the Potential</h3><br/>
		<p>
		After gathering your room measurements and identifying what you’d like to achieve, the Resource journey starts with a call or visit to a showroom.
    There you’ll connect with 		your personal design and production team who will guide you through every aspect of your project (appointments not required, but highly encouraged).
    We’ll first get to know 		you and your aspirations, so we can pinpoint the perfect solutions that beautifully, elegantly fit your exact needs.</p>

		<h3>
		2.Personalized Solutions</h3><br/>
		<p>

		Most of our furnishings are custom and made-to-order. To ensure the best solutions for your project, we’ll take a close look at your floor plans, measurements,
    photos, and 		other unique spatial considerations. For immediate furnishing needs in the US, we have an array of quick ship items ready for delivery, usually within three
    weeks.<p>

		<h3>
		3.Perfecting the Details</h3><br/>
		<p>
		Our expert design associates can assist with space planning to optimize the toughest of layouts. After visiting our showroom, we offer in-home design consultations (to those
    not already working with a designer) to better identify the best products and finishes in your space. For designers, we offer CAD blocks and a sketchup library that can 	
    jumpstart and streamline your design process. Once your furniture is selected, we can provide dimensioned floor plans and 3D renderings so you can envision exactly how your 
    space will be transformed. With final details like finishes and colors decided, we’ll provide a quote and estimated lead time, so you’ll know exactly what to expect.</p>

		<h3>
		4.An Elevated Lifestyle</h3><br/>
		<p>
		Once your design project is complete, you’ll step into a home that exceeds expectations in quality, style, and functionality. All of our wall beds come with a Lifetime 	
    Warranty, and Resource also offers reinstallation services so your furniture can move with you wherever you go.</p>
